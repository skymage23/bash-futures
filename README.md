# bash-futures

"bash-futures" is a Futures implementation for Bash shells. It is written mainly
to help in writing Bash Interactive Shell extensions, for situations where the
human operator needs to kick off a process in order to generate a needed value while
needing to be able to continue to do other work in the meantime.

It is in a very alpha state right now, and only supports Bash.
